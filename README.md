This repository contains the code and documentation of my master thesis at University Ulm
The thesis itself can be read in Masterarbeit.pdf
The max-action/max-method algorithm can be found in Algorithms in pesudocode and as cpp implementation
The algorihms were implemented and tested using the PANDA Framework:
https://github.com/panda-planner-dev
To automatically test the algorithms on IPC2020 Domains the cpp project in the Statcollector folder can be used
